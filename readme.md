**Problem Statement ID:** 25106  
**Organization:** Government of Rajasthan  
**Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)  
**Category:** Software  
**Theme:** Smart Education

## Background
Every student of technical education must complete an internship or industrial-training module before graduation, and most aspire to convert that opportunity into a full-time placement. However, the current process is fragmented: notices are scattered across WhatsApp groups, resumes are sent via email, and approvals require multiple office visits. This leads to missed deadlines, lost applications, and administrative overload for placement cells, who must manually track and update statuses. Local industries also face inefficiencies, but the primary pain is within the campus, where students and staff waste time on administrative tasks instead of focusing on employability and learning.

## Problem Statement
The journey from seeking an internship to securing a placement is cumbersome and inefficient. There is no unified platform for managing applications, approvals, and placements. Students, mentors, and placement officers struggle with manual processes, leading to lost opportunities and increased workload.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a campus-centric, integrated, role-based software portal that:
- Allows the placement cell to post verified internship and industrial-training opportunities.
- Enables students to maintain a single digital profile (cover letter, resume, skills badge sheet) updated once per semester.
- Automatically matches and notifies eligible students based on their skills and preferences.
- Streamlines mentor approvals and interview scheduling, synchronizing with academic timetables.
- Tracks each applicant's journey from application to offer.
- Records supervisor feedback post-training, triggering certificate generation and updating employability records.
- Provides real-time dashboards for placement analytics (e.g., unplaced students, scheduled interviews).
- Ensures strict data privacy and role-based access, so employers see only relevant candidate information.
- Remains license-free or very low-cost, leveraging existing institutional infrastructure.

## Key Features
- **Student Portal:** Profile management, application tracking, one-click apply, feedback and certificate access.
- **Placement Cell Dashboard:** Opportunity posting, analytics, status tracking, and communication tools.
- **Mentor & Supervisor Tools:** Automated approval workflows, interview scheduling, and feedback submission.
- **Employer Access:** Role-based candidate viewing, interview scheduling, and feedback.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Surfaces best-fit roles to students based on competencies and preferences.
- **Data Privacy:** Role-based access control and compliance with institutional data policies.

## Impact
By digitizing and centralizing the internship and placement process, the platform will:
- Reduce administrative burden for students and staff.
- Increase transparency and efficiency in placements.
- Improve student employability outcomes.
- Enable data-driven decision making for campus administrators.
